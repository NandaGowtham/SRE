# SRE

### General Technical Knowledge

1. **What is Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), and how does it differ from traditional operations or DevOps?**
   - **Answer:** Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is a discipline that incorporates aspects of software engineering and applies them to infrastructure and operations problems. The goal is to create scalable and highly reliable software systems. SRE differs from traditional operations in that it emphasizes automation and continuous improvement, while traditional operations often focus more on manual processes and maintenance. Compared to DevOps, SRE has a more explicit focus on reliability and the use of engineering practices to achieve it.

2. **What are SLIs, SLOs, and SLAs? Can you give real-world examples of how they are used?**
   - **Answer:** 
     - **Service Level Indicators (SLIs)** are specific metrics used to measure the performance of a service. Example: Request latency.
     - **Service Level Objectives (SLOs)** are targets for SLIs. Example: 99.9% of requests should have latency under 200ms.
     - **Service Level Agreements (SLAs)** are formal agreements between service providers and customers. Example: A guarantee that 99.9% of requests will have latency under 200ms, with penalties if this is not met.

3. **Explain the concept of error budgets. How would you use them in incident management?**
   - **Answer:** An error budget is the allowable threshold of errors or downtime within a specific period, based on the SLOs. It balances the need for reliability with the pace of innovation. In incident management, an error budget helps prioritize fixes: if the budget is nearly exhausted, focus shifts from deploying new features to stabilizing and improving reliability.

4. **What strategies can be used to achieve high availability in a distributed system?**
   - **Answer:** 
     - Redundancy and failover mechanisms.
     - Load balancing.
     - Distributed data storage.
     - Automated scaling.
     - Continuous monitoring and alerting.

5. **Explain the CAP theorem and its implications for system design.**
   - **Answer:** The CAP theorem states that in a distributed system, you can only achieve two out of three guarantees: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance. Implications: System design must prioritize which two of the three are most critical based on use cases.

6. **How do you ensure system reliability when deploying frequent updates to production?**
   - **Answer:** 
     - Implement continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
     - Conduct thorough automated testing.
     - Use blue-green deployments or canary releases.
     - Monitor and rollback mechanisms.

7. **What is the difference between proactive and reactive monitoring? Give examples.**
   - **Answer:** 
     - **Proactive monitoring** aims to detect and address issues before they impact users. Example: Predictive analytics on disk usage trends to prevent running out of space.
     - **Reactive monitoring** deals with issues after they occur. Example: Receiving alerts when a service goes down and then addressing the outage.

8. **Describe the impact of latency on a web application. How can it be minimized?**
   - **Answer:** High latency can degrade user experience, slow page load times, and increase bounce rates. Minimization strategies include optimizing code, using CDNs, caching frequently accessed data, and optimizing database queries.

9. **What is autoscaling, and how do you configure it in AWS?**
   - **Answer:** Autoscaling is the ability to automatically scale computing resources based on demand. In AWS, this is configured using Auto Scaling Groups, where you define policies that trigger scaling actions based on metrics like CPU utilization or request rate.

10. **What are common causes of CPU, memory, and disk bottlenecks in a system? How would you diagnose and fix them?**
    - **Answer:** 
      - **CPU bottlenecks:** Inefficient code, excessive parallel processes. Diagnose using monitoring tools; optimize code, limit parallelism.
      - **Memory bottlenecks:** Memory leaks, inefficient data handling. Diagnose using profiling tools; fix leaks, optimize data usage.
      - **Disk bottlenecks:** Insufficient I/O throughput, lack of space. Diagnose using I/O monitoring tools; upgrade hardware, optimize I/O operations.
